                <p>A measurement of the computational capacity of a blockchain, commonly calculated by the number of transactions that can be processed per second (TPS). However, TPS is a subjective measure of throughput as transactions can vary in size. An objective measurement of throughput is the number of computational units that can be performed per second.
                </p>

                <p>For example, consider a blockchain that has a limit of 15M computational units per block with a block time of 10 seconds. The objective throughput of the blockchain would be 1.5M units per second. Additionally, throughput can also be used to measure other parameters of a blockchain, such as data capacity.
